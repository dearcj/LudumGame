# LudumGame
Game I made for Ludum Dare competition, rated as #72/4k overall
Typescript + https://github.com/dearcj/Neu

We were thinking about combining a classic strategy board game “Chess” with a dark-fantasy action RPG like a Dark Souls.

Knight was lost on battlefield, and now his white war-horse looking for him in dark mystic islands hovering in the middle of the abyss. This dark place guarded by undead pawns and rooks and filled with death traps.

Game contains 4 levels now. We had a bunch of ideas to implement but we decided to make semi-production art level for this project instead :)
